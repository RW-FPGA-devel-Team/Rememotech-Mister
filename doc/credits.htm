    <P>Relating to the construction of REMEMOTECH, in no particular order...

    <P><B>Geoff Boyd</B>, for designing the Memotech hardware,
    and making it available to me.

    <P><B>Brian Pritchard</B>, author of the MTX Series Operators Manual.
    This is really quite a comprehensive technical document, especially
    towards the end.
    Not only does it reproduce tech sheets from the chip vendors,
    it also includes the full MTX circuit diagrams.
    Invaluable when implementing hardware.

    <P><B>The author of the FDX User Manual</B> and <B>Peter Ketzschmar</B>
    for making a scan of it available from his website.
    Especially useful for the exact pixel layout of the 80 column card.
    See the      
    <A HREF="http://mtxinfo.de/" TARGET="_main">MEMOTECH MTX Computersystem</A> website.

    <P><B>William Brendling</B> for supplying PDF scans of the
    SDX ROM listing.
    The SDX support in REMEMOTECH wouldn't have been possible without this.

    <P>The <B>Zilog Z80 Technical Manual</B> and the
    <B>Zilog Z80 CTC Technical Manual</B>.

    <P><B>Daniel Wallner</B> and <B>Mike J</B> for writing the
    <A HREF="http://opencores.org/project,t80" TARGET="_main">T80 cpu</A> project at
    <A HREF="http://opencores.org/" TARGET="_main">OpenCores</A>.
    Its a microcoded implementation with similar signal interface
    and timings to a real Z80, used in many other retro projects.

    <P><B>Ronivon Costa</B> for writing the
    <A HREF="http://opencores.org/project,z80soc" TARGET="_main">z80soc</A>
    project at
    <A HREF="http://opencores.org/" TARGET="_main">OpenCores</A>,
    which illustrates how to get a basic system going based on the T80.

    <P><B>Mike Stirling</B> for writing some VHDL to get a signed sound
    value "through" the WM8731 CODEC to the speaker, as a part of his
    <A HREF="http://mikestirling.co.uk/bbc-micro-on-an-fpga/" TARGET="_main">BBC Micro on an FPGA</A>
    project.

    <P><B>Lez Anderson</B> for the idea, and letting me know about various
    candidate VHDL.

    <P>Thanks to <B>Claus B&aelig;kkel</B> of MTX World for listing REMEMOTECH on his
    <A HREF="http://www.mtxworld.dk/rememo.php" TARGET="_main">ReMEMOTECH Page</A>,
    and also for a correction to <CODE>in 6</CODE>.

    <P>And me of course, for designing REMEMOTECH, using the information above.
