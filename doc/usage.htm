    <H1>Usage</H1>

    <P>This section covers day to day usage of REMEMOTECH,
    and covers common hints and tips.

<!--...sAfter power on:4:-->
<H2>After power on</H2>

<P>After applying power to the DE1, press and hold KEY1 and KEY0,
press and release KEY3, and then you can let go
(be careful not to press KEY2, as described in
<A HREF="setup.htm#flash">Setting up the Flash</A> on the
<A HREF="setup.htm">Setup</A> page).
This will reset the T80 (KEY3), and cause
<A HREF="software.htm#reboot">REBOOT</A>
to copy the ROM images from Flash to SRAM (KEY1) and
to copy the initial RAM Disc image from Flash to SRAM (KEY0).

<P>Now your REMEMOTECH is ready to go, and indeed, after doing the above,
it will boot to the CP/M prompt.

<P>From now on, to reset REMEMOTECH, you can just press KEY3,
or both Windows keys either side of the space bar.

<P>If both Shift keys are pressed during resetting,
it doesn't boot CP/M and returns to BASIC instead.

<!--...sSpeed:4:-->
<H2>Speed</H2>

<P>SW9 to SW7 control the speed.
SW9 up, SW8 down, SW7 up (<CODE>101</CODE>) corresponds to 4.166MHz
(as 25MHz/(5+1)=4.166MHz), which is the closest setting to the
4MHz that a real Memotech runs at.

<!--...sTyping:4:-->
<H2>Typing</H2>

<P>When typing, note that to type certain characters into the MTX keyboard,
you must type different characters into the PS/2 keyboard.
See the <A HREF="hardware.htm#keyboard">MTX Keyboard</A> section of
the <A HREF="hardware.htm">Hardware</A> page for further details.
This isn't likely to bother you if you are using REMEMOTECH to play
arcade style games.

<!--...sSD Card:4:-->
<H2>SD Card</H2>

<P>Each SD Card can have upto 8 8MB partitions.
Each of these would contain a CP/M 2.2 filesystem.

<P>The Flash image SD Card is different, and contains a raw 512KB
image of the Flash (which contains ROM images and the initial RAM Disc
image).
You wouldn't use this initial Flash image SD Card as a disk,
its only used as a part of the initial <A HREF="setup.htm">Setup</A>
process, see <A HREF="setup.htm#flash">Setting up the Flash</A>.

<P>LEDR0 lights up when REMEMOTECH is reading or writing the SD Card.
Then it flickers and turns off.
Wait for it to turn off before removing or changing the SD Card.

<!--...sAccessing SD Cards from CP\47\M:4:-->
<H3>Accessing SD Cards from CP/M</H3>

<P>You'll need to use <CODE>RECONFIG.COM</CODE> to configure a drive
(or drives) to access partitions on the SD Card.
Type codes 18..1F correspond to 8MB partitions 0 to 7 on the card.
eg: To access partitions 0, 1 and 2 :-
<PRE>
A&gt;RECONFIG B:18,C:19,D:1A</PRE>

<!--...sAccessing SD Cards from MTX BASIC:4:-->
<H3>Accessing SD Cards from MTX BASIC</H3>

<P>You can switch to MTX BASIC, and use <CODE>ROM 5</CODE>
to gain access to disk via <CODE>USER</CODE> commands.
<PRE>
A&gt;MTXL
ROM 5
USER DIR
USER RUN "TOADO.RUN"</PRE>
<!--...e-->
<!--...sAccessing SD Cards from Linux:4:-->
<H3>Accessing SD Cards on Linux</H3>

<P>On my Linux, my SD Card appears as <CODE>/dev/sdc</CODE>
(although this may be different for you), and so I can work directly
with that, or I can use <CODE>dd</CODE> to copy between the device and
a file containing a specific partition, or all 8 partitions.

<P>To read all 8 partitions, or a specific partition,
from the SD Card to file(s) :-
<PRE>
$ dd if=/dev/sdc of=partitions.dat bs=8M        count=8
$ dd if=/dev/sdc of=partition3.dat bs=8M skip=3 count=1</PRE>

<P>To copy back all 8 partitions, or just a specific partition,
from file(s) back to the SD Card :-
<PRE>
$ dd if=partitions.dat of=/dev/sdc bs=8M        count=8
$ dd if=partition3.dat of=/dev/sdc bs=8M seek=3 count=1</PRE>

<P>You can use
<A HREF="http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools/" TARGET="_main">cpmtools</A>
(delivered or packaged for most modern Linux distros)
to manipulate a partition on the SD Card directly, or a present in a file.

<P>You need a <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> <CODE>diskdefs</CODE> file
which includes definitions of the Memotech CP/M filesystem types.
This is included and needs to be in the current directory, or in
<CODE>/usr/share/cpmtools/diskdefs</CODE>.

<P>This file has definitions for <CODE>memotech-type18</CODE>,
<CODE>memotech-type19</CODE> and similar formats.
These are identical, except they have different starting offsets.
So if you are working with a device with all 8 partitions or a file
with all 8 partitions, you simply pick the right format to address
the desired partition.
But if you're working with a file containing just a single partition,
you always use <CODE>memotech-type18</CODE>, as it has an offset of 0.

<P>Some examples :-
<PRE>
$ cpmls -f memotech-type18 /dev/sdc
$ cpmcp -f memotech-type18 /dev/sdc 0:readme.txt /tmp
$ cpmcp -f memotech-type19 /dev/sdc /tmp/readme.txt 0:</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>0:</CODE> notation reflects the CP/M user number.

<P>Alternatively, you can use
<A HREF="http://www.nyangau.org/cpmfuse/cpmfuse.htm" TARGET="_main">cpmfuse</A>,
which is based on <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> and also uses the same
<CODE>diskdefs</CODE> file.

<P>With <CODE>cpmfuse</CODE> you can mount a partition from the
SD Card or a file, and directly manipulate it using normal Linux commands :-
<PRE>
$ mkdir mnt
$ cpmfuse mnt -f memotech-type18 -i /dev/sdc -v
$ ls mnt/*.TXT
mnt/README.TXT
$ fusermount -u mnt</PRE>
<!--...e-->
<!--...sAccessing SD Cards from Windows:4:-->
<H3>Accessing SD Cards on Windows</H3>

<P>If you must use Windows, then these ports of
<A HREF="http://www.chrysocome.net/dd" TARGET="_main">dd</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.cpm8680.com/cpmtools/index.htm" TARGET="_main">cpmtools</A>
are useful.
I put <CODE>dd.exe</CODE> in a directory on the PATH,
and I unzip <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> so that it ends up in the
<CODE>C:\cpmtools</CODE> directory.

<P>The following command adds <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> to your PATH :-
<PRE>
C:\ak\tmp&gt;\cpmtools\cpmtools</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>diskdefs</CODE> supplied with it doesn't understand
Memotech disk formats.
So save it away, and replace with the file supplied :-
<PRE>
C:\ak\tmp&gt;copy \cpmtools\diskdefs \cpmtools\diskdefs.saved
    1 file(s) copied.

C:\ak\tmp&gt;copy diskdefs \cpmtools\diskdefs
Overwrite \cpmtools\diskdefs? (Yes/No/All): Y
    1 file(s) copied.</PRE>

<P>Warning: Don't be tempted to edit the <CODE>diskdefs</CODE> file.
The Windows version of the <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> package expects each line
to end with just a line-feed character (as in UNIX), and most Windows text
editors will terminate each line with carriage-return and line-feed
(as in DOS and Windows).
As a result, <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> will complain it doesn't recognise
disk formats, even though they are in the <CODE>diskdefs</CODE> file.
This is probably an unintentional consequence of how the code was built
on Windows.

<P>The first thing to do is to determine which block device is your
SD Card.
You don't want to accidentally write to your hard disk.
Insert the SD Card and type :-
<PRE>
C:\ak\tmp&gt;dd --filter=removable --list
rawwrite dd for windows version 0.5.

NT Block Device Objects
\\?\Device\Harddisk2\Partition0
link to \\?\Device\Harddisk2\DR7
\\?\Device\Harddisk3\Partition0

Removable media other than floppy. Block size = 512
size is 1015808000 bytes</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>--filter=removable</CODE> ensures the list returned only
includes removable devices.
You're looking for the one around the right size.
In this case, as I'm using a 1GB SD Card, its clearly
<CODE>\\?\Device\Harddisk4\Partition0</CODE>.

<P>As with Linux, you can use <CODE>dd</CODE> to copy all 8 partitions,
or a single partition, between the SD Card and file(s).
Same syntax as above, except the device name is a Windows style name.
However, when copying back, I <U><B>strongly</B></U> recommend you use the
<CODE>--filter=removable</CODE> command line option, which double checks
that you are targetting a removable device (ie: hopefully your SD Card,
rather than your hard disk).

<P>As with Linux, you can use <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> command line programs
to list partition contents and copy files in or out.
I have not been able to get the Windows build of <CODE>cpmtools</CODE>
to work with windows block devices.

<P>Alternatively, you can use
<A HREF="http://www.nyangau.org/cpmcbfs/cpmcbfs.htm" TARGET="_main">cpmcbfs</A>,
which is based on <CODE>cpmtools</CODE> and also uses the same
<CODE>diskdefs</CODE> file.

<P>With <CODE>cpmcbfs</CODE> you can map a drive letter to an image of a
CP/M filesystem, and directly manipulate it using normal Windows commands.
Assuming you've already installed it :-
<PRE>
c:\cpmcbfs&gt;cpmcbfs -f memotech-type18 -i sddisc.bin -v
Drive Z: should exist until you press Enter</PRE>

<P>In another Window :-
<PRE>
c:\&gt;dir z:</PRE>

<P>If you run as Administrator, you can also enumerate block devices and
map drive letters to them.

<P>If the <CODE>dd</CODE> program doesn't work for you
(it doesn't work on my Windows 10 system), you can consider using
<A HREF="http://www.nyangau.org/rawio/rawio.htm" target="_main">RAWIO</A> instead.

<!--...sLoading tapes:4:-->
<H2>Loading tapes</H2>

<P>Prior to switching to MTX BASIC, you can use
<A HREF="software.htm#retape">RETAPE</A> to prime virtual cassette tapes
with the contents of <CODE>.MTX</CODE> files.
From CP/M :-

<PRE>
A&gt;RETAPE QUAZZIA.MTX 1
A&gt;RETAPE SNAPPO.MTX 2
A&gt;RETAPE TIMEBAND.MTX 3
A&gt;MTXL</PRE>

<P>Then the usual MTX BASIC <CODE>LOAD</CODE> command can be used to
load it :-
<PRE>LOAD "QUAZZIA"</PRE>

<P>Running <CODE>RETAPE</CODE> with no arguments lists bytes 1-15
of the virtual cassette in each slot, which is handy, as these
are the names you will need to <CODE>LOAD</CODE> from MTX BASIC.
These names do not necessarily agree with the names of the
<CODE>.MTX</CODE> files they were loaded from.
