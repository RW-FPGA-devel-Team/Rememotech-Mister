    <A HREF="hardware.htm#printer">printer</A> support,
    proper pin compatible <A HREF="hardware.htm#port7">port 7</A> support,
    external <A HREF="hardware.htm#rom2">ROM 2</A> support,
    and improved <A HREF="hardware.htm#vga">secondary VGA</A> support.
    Also supporting a <A HREF="hardware.htm#serial">serial</A> port.

    <P><B>REMEMOTECH</B> is a modern-day re-implementation of a
    Memotech MTX/FDX/SDX compatible computer :-
    <UL>
      <LI>in VHDL
      <LI>re-using existing VHDL definitions of major chips
      <LI>writing VHDL definitions of missing chips
      <LI>writing the glue logic in VHDL
      <LI>synthesizing for a
          <A HREF="http://datasheet.octopart.com/EP2C20F484C7-Altera-datasheet-1735.pdf" TARGET="_main">Cyclone II</A>
          FPGA
      <LI>targetting an
          <A HREF="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?No=83" TARGET="_main">Altera DE1</A>
          board
      <LI>exploiting the hardware on the board, around the FPGA,
          such as clock, connectors, Flash, SRAM,
          VGA DACs, sound CODEC, SD Card, ...
    </UL>

    <P>It implements enough hardware to allow it to run
    MTX BASIC, various MTX games and CP/M.
    It supports :-
    <UL>
      <LI>Z80 compatible CPU, at 4.166MHz and other speeds upto 25MHz
      <LI>384KB RAM, 72KB ROM
      <LI>PS/2 keyboard
      <LI>VDP, outputting to 640x480 @ 50Hz (or 60Hz) VGA
      <LI>Sound chip
      <LI>80 column card support, with 80x24 and 80x48 modes,
          outputting to 640x480 @ 60Hz VGA
      <LI>Whether VDP or 80 column output appears on main VGA output switchable
      <LI>The other display can appear on another VGA, via a daughter card
      <LI>RAM Disc support (upto 320KB)
      <LI>SD Card as a large and fast alternative to floppy disk
      <LI>Modified SDX ROM using SD Card and RAM Disc instead of floppy disk
      <LI>Virtual cassette support
      <LI>Numeric accelerator
      <LI>Serial port support
      <LI>Centronics printer support, via a daughter card
      <LI>Port 7 support, via a daughter card
      <LI>External ROM 2 support, via a daughter card
    </UL>

    <P>It was developed because I had previously implemented the
    <A HREF="http://www.nyangau.org/memu/memu.htm" TARGET="_main">MEMU</A>
    Memotech emulator and this was the next logical challenge.
    As a starting point, I knew nothing about VHDL or hardware design.
    It was a great learning opportunity.

    <P>REMEMOTECH reproduces most of the MTX functionality, including
    some from FDX and and some from SDX.
    New features have been added where existing software is able to benefit
    from them.

    <P>The implementation tries to stick to non-vendor specific VHDL,
    avoids vendor megafunctions, and might work with some tweaks on other
    boards or vendor technologies.
    A few Quartus specific features are needed in order to squeeze REMEMOTECH
    into the Altera DE1 board (these are commented as such in the code).

    <P><A HREF="http://www.nyangau.org/rememorizer/rememorizer.htm" TARGET="_main">REMEMOrizer</A>
    is an attempt to apply the technology developed here to create
    an add-on for Memotech owners.
