        <TD NOWRAP>2012-04-08
        <TD>Implements VDP, CTC, sound chip, virtual cassette,
            and is able to run lots of games.
      <TR>
        <TD>2012-04-30
        <TD>SDX ROM added.
            and is able to run lots of games.
        <BR>This completes the REMEMOTECH <B>r1</B>.
        <BR>Three known systems built:
            mine, one by Dave Stevenson, one I built and sent to Geoff Boyd.
      <TR>
        <TD>2016-10-19
        <TD>Start of work on REMEMOTECH <B>r2</B>.
        <BR>Numeric Accelerator from REMEMOrizer added,
            as demoed at Memofest 2016 in Aberdeen.
      <TR>
        <TD>2017-02-05
        <TD>Upgrade of Linux to Fedora 25
            and corresponding upgrade of Quartus to 13.0sp1.
        <BR>Removal of some compile time warnings.
        <BR>Removal of clock-crossing-domain problem in sound chip,
            which was a bug right from the start, but only seems to occur
            post the r1 release.
            Side effect of the fix is that the tone of the sound chip output
            varies very slightly depending on processor speed setting.
        <BR>Addition of initial implementation of port 7.
      <TR>
        <TD>2019-10-12

        <BR>Start of work on REMEMOTECH <B>r3</B>.
        <BR>Serial port support.
        <BR>Daughter board.
        <BR>Centronics support.
        <BR>Proper port 7 support.
        <BR>External ROM 2 EEPROM support.
        <BR>Proper 2nd VGA support.

    <P>Copying of the included VHDL is encouraged.
    Respect the licenses of included VHDL written by others.
    The included ROMs either are the original ROMs from real Memotech
    computers, or are derived from them, and these images are readily
    available on the net already.
    Copying the included driver code is probably ok as it was derived from
    code developed by Memotech itself, long since defunct.
    Caveat Emptor.

    <P>The initial RAM Disc image includes parts of CP/M 2.2.
    CP/M is
    <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/11/26/cp_m_collection_is_back/" TARGET="_main">open source</A>
    and is downloadable
    <A HREF="http://www.cpm.z80.de/" TARGET="_main">here</A> and other places.

    <P>If you have a REMEMOTECH r3 or later, I may have a daughter board
    I can send you.

    <P>The author of REMEMOTECH and this documentation is <B>Andy Key</B>
